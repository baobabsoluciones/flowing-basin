**Flowing Basin** is a research project focused on the
optimization of hydropower stations having multiple reservoirs.
Unlike previous studies, we address a short-term intraday
optimization problem with the objective of maximizing revenue.
This variant of the problem is called the
Hydropower Reservoirs Intraday Economic Optimization (HRIEO) problem.

We used a variety of methods to tackle the HRIEO problem:
- **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**: an exact linearized optimization
model for the HRIEO problem implemented in [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp).
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: a metaheuristic algorithm
adapted to the HRIEO problem and based on [PySwarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms).
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: a machine learning approach
involving an agent that learns by interacting with an environment.
In this repository, the environment for the HRIEO problem is based on [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium)
and the agent is trained in this environment using [Stable Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).

The HRIEO problem, the MILP model and the PSO algorithm
are detailed in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10100-024-00934-z).
The RL approach is explained in this paper.
