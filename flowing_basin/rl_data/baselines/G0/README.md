This folder should contain the solutions of other solvers
under the same conditions as the RL models for general config `GO`:
 - Instances for 2 dams and 1 day.
 - No bonus or penalty for objective final volumes.
 - Flow smoothing parameter set to 2.
 - Startup and limit zone penalty of 50â‚¬.

**NOTE**: the MILP solutions were calculated
in the `pso-rbo-parameters-and-milp-comparison` branch
(which has the most updated version of the MILP model).
