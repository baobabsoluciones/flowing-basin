This folder should contain the solutions of other solvers
under the same conditions as the RL models for general config `G21`:
 - Instances for 6 dams and 1 day.
 - No bonus or penalty for objective final volumes.
 - No flow smoothing, but maximum relative variation of 20%.
 - Startup and limit zone penalty of 50â‚¬.

**NOTE**: the solutions were calculated in `flowing_basin/scripts/baseline.py`.
