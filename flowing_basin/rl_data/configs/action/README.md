- `A0`: the agent gives relative variations of flow.
- `A1`: the agent gives the exiting flows directly.
- `A110`: the agent gives the exiting flows for the next 9 (99 // 11) timesteps.
- `A111`: the agent gives the exiting flows for the next 20 (~ 99 // 5) timesteps.
- `A112`: the agent gives the exiting flows for the next 33 (99 // 3) timesteps.
- `A113`: the agent gives the exiting flows for the next 99 (99 // 1) timesteps.
- `A21`: the agent adjusts the actions of the solution (initially rl-greedy's) until it no longer improves.
- `A22`: like A21, but the initial greedy actions are taken with a greeediness of 80% instead of 100%
(which has similar performance and avoids clipping all positive adjustments).
- `A23`: like A22, but Gaussian noise with 0.15 standard deviation is added to the initial greedy actions.
- `A24`: like A21, but the initial actions are completely random (no greediness).
- `A31`: the agent can only choose among the given optimal flows.
- `A32`: the agent chooses the flow from the given number of discretization levels for each dam.
- `A33`: the agent chooses the turbine count and the flow level within this number of turbines.
- `A313`: like A31, but making the choice for the next 99 (99 // 1) timesteps.
- `A323`: like A32, but making the choice for the next 99 (99 // 1) timesteps.
- `A333`: like A33, but making the choice for the next 99 (99 // 1) timesteps.
